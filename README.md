## Projects

## Project 1: 

Facial Recognition API for a Picture Sharing Mobile Application

## Overview: 
I developed a facial recognition API integrated into a picture-sharing mobile application. The API was designed to accurately identify and verify users based on facial features, ensuring perfect user experiences.

## Key Technologies:

DLIB: Utilized the DLIB library, incorporating the FaceNet model for face recognition.
FaceNet Model: Extracted 512 distinctive facial features , providing high accuracy and reliability.
Mediapipe Model: Implemented the Mediapipe model to complement FaceNet by extracting 468 facial landmarks, enhancing the precision of the facial recognition process.

## Achievements:

Achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 99% in facial recognition, ensuring high security and user satisfaction.

## Outcome: 

The API was successfully deployed, significantly improving the app's security and user engagement by providing seamless and accurate facial recognition¬†capabilities.

## Project 2:

Automatic Parking Ticket Generator

## Overview: 

Developed an automated parking ticket generation system that records vehicle entry and exit times, identifies vehicle types, and calculates parking fees based on the duration of stay.

## Key Technologies:

YOLOv7: Utilized YOLOv7 object detection model to recognize vehicle license plates and classify vehicle types (e.g., sedan, SUV, van).
OCR: Applied Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and read license plate numbers from detected plates. The extracted numbers were then stored in a database for further processing.

## Features:

Vehicle Detection: Detected and classified vehicles in real-time using YOLOv7.
License Plate Recognition: Extracted license plate numbers using OCR and recorded them in the system.
Time Tracking: Logged entry and exit times for each vehicle.
Billing Calculation: Calculated total parking charges based on the duration of each vehicle's stay in the parking facility.
Outcome: The system efficiently automated the process of parking ticket generation, enhanced accuracy in vehicle identification and billing, and streamlined the overall parking management process.
